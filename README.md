# petzku's Aegisub karaoke templates

Most of my karaoke templates, collected in one place. Lyrics generally not mine, code _mostly_ mine (but often borrowing from others' work).

Stuff in `songs/` is song styling, stuff in `ts/` is various templates I've written to make repetitive typesetting easier. These obviously have very different purposes, but the methodogy can often be quite the same—and I've on occasion ended up reusing some TS things in later song styling. Funny, that...

## Usage

Designed for [Aegisub][aegisub] auto4 karaoke templaters, mostly [`0x.KaraTemplater`][0x]. Most templates have other module dependencies, including [KaraOK][karaok], [`0x.color`][0x], [`petzku.easings`][petzku] and [ILL][ill]. Notably, the last two are installable from DependencyControl. My templates will generally include a "README" that describes usage in brief. As usual, any modules should go in your `automation/include` directory, e.g. `$HOME/.aegisub/automation/include/petzku/easings.moon`.

You are free to use, modify, and redistribute the templates in this repo as you wish, but credit is always appreciated. You are **NOT** free to reuse or redistribute lyrics without appropriate permission (as I am not their owner), but it's not like I can stop you.
