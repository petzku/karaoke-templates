# petzku's Aegisub karaoke templates

Most of my karaoke templates, collected in one place. Lyrics generally not mine, code _mostly_ mine (but often borrowing from others' work).

## Usage

Designed for [Aegisub][aegisub] auto4 karaoke templaters, mostly [`0x.KaraTemplater`][0x]. Most templates have other module dependencies, including [KaraOK][karaok], [`0x.color`][0x], [`petzku.easings`][petzku] and [ILL][ill]. Notably, the last two are installable from DependencyControl. My templates will generally include a "README" that describes usage in brief. As usual, any modules should go in your `automation/include` directory, e.g. `$HOME/.aegisub/automation/include/petzku/easings.moon`.

You are free to use, modify, and redistribute the templates in this repo as you wish, but credit is always appreciated. You are **NOT** free to reuse or redistribute lyrics without appropriate permission (as I am not their owner), but it's not like I can stop you.
